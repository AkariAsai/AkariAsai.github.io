We hosted the NeurIPS 2025 Competition [NeurIPS 2025 Competition: MMU-RAGent: Massive Multi-Modal User-Centric Retrieval Augmented Generation Benchmark](https://neurips.cc/virtual/2025/competition/127730). and it sparked lots of great discussion and takeaways for future modeling and evaluation. Stay tuned for our write-up!  The slides for my [DR Tulu](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19399) talk are available [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1_ggNo_w548bMwTNedhCccYdY8CmpptuPHlMY45Ah1Vs/edit?usp=sharing).
