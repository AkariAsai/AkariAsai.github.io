I've completed my Ph.D! I’ll be joining Carnegie Mellon University as an Assistant Professor in Fall 2026, affiliated with the Language Technologies Institute and (by courtesy) the Machine Learning Department! From July 2025 to August 2026, I’ll be a Research Scientist at the Allen Institute for AI!
