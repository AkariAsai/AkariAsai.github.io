Super excited to share [**DR Tulu**](https://allenai.org/blog/dr-tulu) - an open, end-to-end trained deep research agent for long-form, real-world research tasks. We introduce a new RL recipe, **Reinforcement Learning with Evolving Rubrics (RLER)**, to tackle the inherently hard-to-verify nature of deep research. Check out [our paper](https://allenai.org/papers/drtulu) and [a static demo](https://dr-tulu.github.io/). A live demo is coming soon so please stay tuned!
