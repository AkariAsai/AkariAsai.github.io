I'm SUPER excited to release [OpenScholar](https://openscholar.allen.ai/), my latest collaboration project with amazing co-authors from UW, Ai2, Meta and CMU, Stanford, UIUC and UNC. Try out our public demo, and learn more about the project in [the paper](https://openscholar.allen.ai/paper) and [Ai2 blog](https://allenai.org/blog/openscholar).
