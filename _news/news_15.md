I'm hornoed to be chosen as [MIT Technology Review Innovators Under 35 from Japan](https://www.technologyreview.jp/s/348608/the-winners-of-innovators-under-35-japan-2024-have-been-announced/)! See [the MIT Technology Review article about my work](https://www.technologyreview.jp/l/innovators_jp/348573/akari-asai/) on retrieval-augmented LMs to build more reliable LM-based systems.
