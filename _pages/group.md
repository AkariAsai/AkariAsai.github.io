Interested in joining my group? Thank you for your interest! Please read the following information before reaching out!

#### If you're applying to the CMU SCS Ph.D. program:

For the 2026 application cycle, I expect to recruit 2 - 3 Ph.D. students. Due to the volume of inquiries, I’m not able to respond to individual emails or review applications before the deadline. During the admissions season, I also cannot answer questions about application status (via email or public office hours). Please note that different schools/departments have different admissions processes and timelines. 

- **Which Ph.D. programs to apply to:** I'm affiliated with CMU’s Language Technologies Institute (LTI) and the Machine Learning Department (MLD). If you'd like me to see your application, please apply to LTI or MLD and list me under "Faculty of Interest" in the department application form. If my name isn't listed there, I may inadvertently miss your application even if you mention in SoP. I may review applications from other SCS departments (e.g., CSD, RI, S3D, HCII), but those are less likely to reach me directly. Generally, at CMU, I recommend applying to the department(s) where your faculty of interest are officially affiliated, since each department reviews applications independently. If you're already admitted to a CMU SCS PhD program and think our research interests align, I'm happy to chat (see the next section).

- **Which areas I'm looking for**: I work broadly on LLMs and multimodal LMs. I'm especially excited about augmented LMs, systems that pair models with complementary components and external tools (e.g., RAG, agents), and their system-level challenges (efficiency, scalability). I also apply these methods to real-world problems (e.g., scientific applications) and study safety and societal issues in LMs, including hallucinations and copyright. That said, the topics are not fixed and I'm more excited to hear what *you* are interested in working on! 

- **What I look for in students**: I enjoy working with students from diverse backgrounds who are curious, rigorous, and collaborative—and who care about building systems with real-world impact. I (like many faculty) genuinely enjoy reading SoPs: please highlight your interests, link your prior research to your goals, and make your strengths clear. Strong foundations in computer science, engineering, and mathematics are important. 

I'm not able to provide feedback on individual application materials. That said, many universities offer free, Ph.D.-student–run mentorship programs that help with Ph.D. applications including SoP feedback. I encourage you to apply early. One example is [CMU SCS’s Application Support Program](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/academics/phd/application-support) (already closed for 2025–2026). 

#### If you're a current or incoming CMU SCS Ph.D. student (LTI, MLD, CSD etc.):

If you're a Ph.D. student in CMU SCS and interested in collaborating, feel free to email or Slack me with a brief summary of your research interests or projects. I’ll be splitting my time between Pittsburgh and Seattle in 2025–2026 and would love to explore potential collaborations! 


#### If you're a CMU undergraduate or M.S. student:
Thanks so much for your interest! I love working with undergraduate and master’s students; many such collaborations have led to publications at ACL, COLM, NeurIPS, and more, and helped students launch research-focused careers. 

To ensure a meaningful experience, I typically ask for two things: 

- **Strong foundation**: I generally consider students who have completed core courses in machine learning and NLP. This background helps ensure you can engage deeply with the research. 
- **Time commitment**: I ask for a consistent commitment of 10–20 hours per week. If you're currently balancing a heavy course load, job search, or other responsibilities, I recommend waiting until you have more bandwidth. Research takes time and consistency, and my goal is to support your long-term growth, not just a short-term project. 

If you're interested, please fill out [this google form](https://forms.gle/2igzAgfL7BZnjUJb7) (Please sign in with your CMU email address. This form is intended for current CMU students, so **please don't request access or sharing permissions**. If you are not a CMU undergraduate student and are interested in working with me, please see the section below.), including your transcript and CV. I may not be able to respond to all requests, but I’ll reach out if I think we might be a good match for a project. 


#### If you're an external undergraduate, M.S., or Ph.D. student seeking internships or visiting/postdoc positions:

In 2025–2026, I’ll be a Research Scientist at AI2 and won’t be able to host visiting students at CMU (if you are interested in working with me at Ai2 for internship / pre-doc, apply from [Ai2's career](https://allenai.org/careers) page!). Also in 2026, I am unlikely to have the capacity to advise students outside CMU during the academic year, but I may announce future opportunities on my website or social media, so please stay tuned! 

For undergrad internships, CMU SCS offers several summer internship programs: [Summer Research Fellowships at CMU](https://www.cmu.edu/uro/summer%20research%20fellowships/SURF/) In the future, I may host 1–2 summer interns through these programs, so please stay tuned!


#### Looking for general advice on research / Ph.D. applications, etc. 
I restarted my public office hours each week, open to anyone to chat about research, career, or anything else this summer! While I can't guarantee positions, this is meant to offer mentorship, especially for those with limited access. Please sign up from [Google Calendar](calendar.app.google/3daW5UMPCNc7qJdQA)
