I am currently in my final year of pursuing a Ph.D. in NLP at Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering, University of Washington. I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Hannaneh Hajishirzi](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~hannaneh/index.html). I am also spending some time at [Meta AI Research](https://ai.meta.com/research/) as a visiting student researcher, under the supervision of [Dr. Wen-tau Yih](https://scottyih.org/). Prior to joining UW, I obtained a B.E. in [Electrical Engineering and Computer Science](https://www.ee.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/) from The University of Tokyo, Japan.

**I am on the academic job market this year! Please feel free to reach out if you'd like to discuss opportunities. I am attending NeurIPS!**

My research focuses on natural language processing and machine learning, with a particular emphasis on large language models (LLMs). I investigate the core limitations of LLMs---such as hallucinations---that cannot be overcome by scaling alone. To address these challenges, I pioneered [**Retrieval-Augmented LMs**](https://acl2023-retrieval-lm.github.io/), a novel class of LLMs that integrate large-scale text data via retrieval during inference. More specifically,

- **Establishing the Necessity of Retrieval-Augmented LMs** -- I have systematically researched the failure modes of LLMs, and was among the first to develop retrieval-augmented approaches as a solution. My work has shown their effectiveness for (1) reducing hallucinations e.g.,  [Adaptive Retrieval-augmented LM (ACL 2023 Oral, Best Video Award)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10511), (2) achieving more compute-efficient scaling e.g, [MassiveDS (NeurIPS 2024)](https://huggingface.co/papers/2407.12854); (3) staying updated with real-time knowledge changes e.g., [Real-time QA (NeurIPS D&B 2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.13332). I've taught [the first tutorial of retrieval-augmented LMs](https://acl2023-retrieval-lm.github.io/).

- **Building the Foundations of Retrieval-Augmented LMs** -- I have establish the foundational components of retrieval-augmented LMs, developing better architectures, training strategies, and inference techniques like [Self-RAG (ICLR Oral-Top 1%, 2024)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11511), [Evidentiality-guided RAG (NAACL Oral, 2022)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.08688) and [FAVA (COLM 2024)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06855). Iâ€™ve advanced retrieval systems to be more versatile [(TART, Findings of ACL 2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09260), more robust to complex queries [(Path Retriever, ICLR 2020)](https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJgVHkrYDH)[(LUKE, EMNLP 2020; 1 million downloads on HF)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.01057), and more efficient [(Binary Passage Retriever, ACL 2021)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.00882).


- **Making Real-world Impacts through Retrieval-Augmented LMs** -- I advance the frontiers of Retrieval-Augmented LMs by addressing critical real-world challenges, particularly in contexts where information is scarce or fragmented. My work focuses on: (1) Developing reliable LMs for expert domain tasks, such as scientific research [(Open Scholar, 2024))](https://allenai.org/blog/openscholar) or code generation ([CodeRAG-Bench, 2024](https://code-rag-bench.github.io/)), and (2) improving information access across world languages (e.g., [CORA, NeurIPS 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.11976); [XOR QA, NAACL 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11856); [AfriQA, Findings of EMNLP, 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06897)).


My work has received multiple paper awards at conferences like ACL and NeurIPS workshop, and has been featured in major media outlets such as [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbestechcouncil/2024/07/30/how-rag-powered-ai-applications-have-a-positive-impact-on-businesses/) and [MIT Technology Review](https://www.technologyreview.com/2018/02/05/145813/100000-happy-moments/). I'm honored to be named among the [EECS Rising Stars (2022)](https://risingstars.utexas.edu/profiles/akari-asai), the [IBM Global Ph.D. Fellow (2022-2023)](https://news.cs.washington.edu/2022/10/20/lost-in-translation-no-more-ibm-fellowship-winner-akari-asai-asks-and-answers-big-questions-in-nlp-to-expand-information-access-to-all/) and one of [MIT Technology Review Innovators Under 35 from Japan (2024)](https://www.technologyreview.jp/l/innovators_jp/348573/akari-asai/). My work is now integrated into major libraries like [huggingface transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/model_doc/luke), [LlamaIndex](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/api_reference/packs/self_rag/) and [LangChain](https://blog.langchain.dev/agentic-rag-with-langgraph/), and used in multiple real-world systems, such as [COVID-19 Research Search](https://www.salesforce.com/news/stories/salesforce-research-develops-new-search-engine-to-support-the-fight-against-covid-19/). Most recently, we released [Ai2 OpenScholar Public Demo](https://openscholar.allen.ai/) for free, assisting scientists to synthesize scientific literature more effectively and efficiently.

I am also passionate about teaching, mentoring and helping students to learn research, especially students from underrepresented groups.
I have been the Head TA for [CSE473: Intro to AI (undergrad)](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse473/23au/) and [CSE599J: Data-centric ML (graduate)](https://koh.pw/cse599j/) at UW. To reduce the barrier to start research or Ph.D. in this area, I'm hosting weekly office hours open to everyone (please sign up from [Calendly](https://calendly.com/akari-asai/office-hour)!), and am a mentor for [UW CSE Ph.D. Pre-Application Mentorship Service (PAMS)](https://www.cs.washington.edu/academics/phd/admissions/pams).
